GROUP CACHING - QUICK REFERENCE
================================

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
Saves discovered groups to cache file, eliminating 5-10 minute discovery on every startup.

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. First time: Discovers groups (5-10 min) → Saves to cache
2. Next times: Loads from cache (< 1 second)
3. Manual refresh: Use 'scan' command

COMMANDS:
---------

start   - Start scanner (uses cache if available)
          First run: Discovers groups
          Later runs: Loads from cache instantly

scan    - Force re-discovery (clears cache)
          Use when: Join/leave groups, want fresh list
          Requires: Scanner must be stopped first

stop    - Stop scanner (required before 'scan')

list    - View cached groups

TYPICAL WORKFLOW:
-----------------

# First time or after joining new groups
Enter command: scan
[Wait 5-10 minutes]

# Daily use (instant)
Enter command: start
✓ Loaded 417 groups from cache

CACHE FILE:
-----------
Location: discovered_groups.json
Size: ~500 KB for 417 groups
Safe to delete: Will be recreated on next discovery

WHEN TO USE 'scan':
-------------------
✓ After joining new groups
✓ After leaving groups
✓ Group list seems outdated
✓ Weekly refresh (recommended)

✗ Don't use on every startup (defeats caching purpose)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Problem: Groups seem outdated
Solution: stop → scan → start

Problem: Cache not loading
Solution: Delete discovered_groups.json, then start

Problem: Scan command fails
Solution: Make sure scanner is stopped first

TIME SAVINGS:
-------------
Without caching: 5-10 minutes every startup
With caching: < 1 second every startup
Savings: 5-10 minutes per startup!
